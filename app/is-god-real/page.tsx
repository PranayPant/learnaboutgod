      <h1>Is God Real?</h1>
      <article>
        Many have asked this question, or some variation of this question.
        Although there are some who will refuse to believe in God even if he was
        standing in front of them, many of us have some degree of faith that
        there is a higher power that controls all of creation. Yet, we are all
        still plagued by doubts and questions regarding His existence. These
        doubts are a product of our ignorance - we can only see the physical
        reality around us, but not the person who created it. To slay these
        weeds of doubt, we need the sword of divine wisdom so that the flower of
        Faith may bloom in full.

      <h2>What is the proof that God exists?</h2>
      <article>
        There are three main ways to know something and prove its existence.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Proof by Observation</strong>
            <p>
              We can use the five knowledge acquiring senses (sight, sound,
              smell, taste, touch) to gather information about the world. These
              senses are designed to give feedback about external stimuli, from
              which we can make logical inferences about our environment. For
              example, if you are in a dark room and cannot see, you can still
              use your sense of touch to tell where the furniture is. If your
              phone goes off, you can hear where it is and infer where your bed
              must be, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this way of knowing is imperfect. One example is that of
              a mirage - many times when driving on a hot day, we see what
              appears to be a puddle of water on the road, but it quickly
              disappears as we get near that spot. Sometimes we cannot make out
              where exactly a sound is coming from, and we mistake it to be
              coming from teh attic, say, instead of the garage or even outside
              the house. This is due to the fact that our senses are imperfect
              and our mind, which processes the data that our senses gather, is
              also imperfect. Even the most accurate machines do output
              incorrect data from time to time. Therefore, not being able to see
              or hear God in no way proves that He is not real. Forturantely,
              there is another way to know.

            <strong>Proof by Logical Inference</strong>
            <p>
              If you saw a puddle on teh highway in the middle of July in Texas,
              you mighgt doubt if that is real, due to the fact that it is too
              hot for a small puddle to stay and not evaporate. This is an
              example of logical infernece. Even though our eyes are seeing one
              thing, our logical inference says something opposite. Another
              example would be inferring the prescence of fire upon seeing
              smoke. We have not actually seen the smoke, but we know from basic
              sense that smoke can only be created by fire, so there would have
              to be fire somewhere closeby. This is a powerful method by which
              we can understand the world around us, including God. There is one
              way that is even more powerful, however, and will be essential for
              us to have complete knowledge of God.

              Our ability to infer is limited by our knowledge and expertise in
              a particular field. This is why scientists often change theur
              views after several decades, because by then there is new
              knowledge that undermines the inferneces made by the previous
              generation. Ultimately, since we did not create all of creation,
              we are not the best equipped to know how everything works.

              Imagine trying to fix a car without a service manual. Having to
              learn everything by using the ascending process of learning (e.g.
              the scientific method) would be very time consuming and lead to
              more faulures than we could ever tolerate. By consulting a trusted
              authority like the manufacturer provided service manual, we are
              able to save a lot of time and get the results we want. The key
              here is that the autority is knowledgeable and the student trusts
              said authority.

      <h2>Putting it all together</h2>
      <article>
        Let us know go back to the main question: Is God Real? To answer this
        question, we will first use logical inference.
        <p>
          Yes, God is real. It takes an intelligent being to create something
          intelligent, the most obvious example being the human body. To say He
          is not real is to say things create themselves, which is absurd. If we
          say a five course meal set up on a table in our house but no physical
          sign of anyone being there, we would still never assume that the mean
          manifested by itself. Perhaps your friends are surpsiing you, perhaps
          your Mom came from out of town and decided to cook for but had to
          leave right away...literally anything is more plausible except that
          idea that it manifested itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another super obvious way to infer God is to realize the death is
          real. What happens at death? The physical, insentient body is
          separated from the subtle, sentient Soul. In order to understand this,
          we have to first understand that we are not our bodies, we are the
          conscousness inhabitting our bodies. Once we accpet that, accepting
          that God is the one reesponsible for orchestrating life and death
          comes naturally.
